# GaleShapleyMatching
This is a solution to the Stable marriage problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) that uses 
the Gale Shapley Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm).
I'm currently working on a graphical interface to make it look nicer.
